                              <p>
                                Ron has more than 20 years of experience with Linux and is a former Debian Developer. He has also worked in
                                the hosting industry for over 10 years with technologies such as Xen, OpenVZ, and Linux KVM. Some of his
                                professional interests include virtual machines, networking, security, cryptography, programming, distributed
                                and parallel computing, and finding new ways to automate mundane tasks. In his spare time, Ron likes to fly
                                drones, toy with cryptocurrencies, find new uses for Raspberry Pi boards, play video and board games, make
                                things with 3D printers, go boating and camping in the Pacific Northwest, hangout with his cat Eva, and of
                                course spend time with his family.
                                One fun fact is that Ron’s cat, Eva, was named after a character from the movie WALL-E because as a kitten
                                she was all-white and very rambunctious.

                                Ivan has devoted all of his spare energy to teaching himself the ways of GNU, Free Software, Open Source,
                                Linux and the sorcery of what is called, quite fashionably in IT today, the art of systems engineering. Much to
                                his content he's living his dream, and is grateful and proud to be part of a company that shares a similar creed.
                                In whatever little free time he has, he enjoys riding his Austrian KTM hard tail mountain bike all around and
                                across the ancient city of Lviv. He cannot imagine his life without music, and you can often hear rhythmic sounds
                                of American blues, jazz, instrumental piano or some cosmic chill-out tunes, but also rebellious war cries of
                                counterculture hardcore punk and, you might say oddly, sweet, sweet J-pop songs in his apartment.
                                A fun fact about Ivan is that he hates telling fun facts about himself, but if you insisted, he would say that he's
                                Ivan IV and this lineage of men in his family tree sharing exactly the same full name for four generations straight
                                is believed to be quite unintentional.

                                accomplished Python web developer also. However, his most prized achievement is getting his sound card to work under Debian Slink.
                                In his time away from Postgres, he bakes bread, kicks deer out of his yard, and ventures into the mountains of the PNW.

                    Our marketing and sales are not polished. We focus our dollars on having a best of breed technical staff,
                    which includes support and engineers, who will listen and provide solutions to your PostgreSQL issues with
                    nothing but the best assistance.

                    We document everything we do. If you contract with Command Prompt to provide support for a project, we
                    document each task, require each task in writing, and insure that there is an electronic trail of all tasks
                    performed to insure the highest quality of service.
